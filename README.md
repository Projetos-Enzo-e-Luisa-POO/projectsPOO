# Bigger OO Projects

This repository was used for delivering collaborative projects for an undergrad OO couse at UNICAMP.

You will find the two projects in their respective folders, applying, on a bigger scale, OO concepts for architecture design. Feel free to explore and see our ideas (from 2022) on OO problem solving!

### Collaborators:
